            consisting of reputable OG's and newbies in crypto. The primary
            purpose behind its establishment was as a result of a growing
            concern for loss of funds invested into DeFi projects. This led us
            to build a community where projects are vetted by the KeepitDeFi
            team before they are pushed to community members.

          </div>

          <div className="privacy-section1-text4">
            Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is an emerging financial technology
            based on secure distributed ledgers similar to those used by
            cryptocurrencies. The system removes the control banks and related
            financial institutions have on money, financial products, and
            financial services. DeFi eliminates the fees and charges that banks
            and other financial companies charge its customers for the use of
            their services. As a user, hold your money in a secure digital
            wallet instead of keeping it in a bank. Anyone with an internet
            connection can use it without needing approval from a central
            authority. A user can transfer funds in seconds and minutes.
